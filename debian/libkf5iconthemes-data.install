# This is using a very global pattern because otherwise the CI systems
# have trouble mangling it since presently they do not actually contain l10n
# but this package contains locale/en_US/kf5_entry.desktop coming from the
# source, so the CI systems cannot blanket remove all locale paths from install
# or they'd break this.
